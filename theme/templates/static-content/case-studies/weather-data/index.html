    <h1>{{ _('Weather data for irrigation scheduling/crop modelling') }}</h1>
    <h2>The data</h2>
	<p>The Queensland Government,  through the <a href="/">Open Data portal</a>, provides  access to historical weather information for Queensland in the form of patched  point datasets. End users access the data through the government’s <a href="/dataset/silo-patched-point-datasets-for-queensland">Scientific  Information for Land Owners (SILO)</a> application.</p>
	<h2>The user</h2>
	<p>AgriTech Solutions, a specialist provider of irrigation  management and agronomy consulting services, uses <a href="/dataset/silo-patched-point-datasets-for-queensland">SILO</a> to gather weather information for predictive crop modelling.</p>
	<h2>The business benefit</h2>
	<p>The SILO patched  point data feeds into a web-based sugarcane irrigation scheduling tool called <a href="http://www.irrigweb.com/">IrrigWeb</a>. Developed by <a href="http://www.SQRSoftware.com">SQR Software Pty Ltd</a> in Brisbane, <a href="http://www.irrigweb.com/">IrrigWeb</a> uses a sugarcane crop model,  CANEGRO, to calculate sugarcane crop water use and yield outputs. This  information helps farmers optimise their water management strategies.</p>
	<p>SILO provides meteorological data for around 800 locations throughout  Queensland. If the daily data from a specific point is missing or considered  unreliable, it is interpolated – or ‘patched’ – using observed data from  surrounding locations.<br clear="all" />
	</p>
	<h2>Information for improved  decision making</h2>
	<p>The information  generated by the model helps sugarcane producers plan their irrigation requirements  – when to apply and how much – so that their irrigation efficiency is  maximised, irrigation inputs are minimised and productivity is increased.</p>
	<p>Sugarcane Cropping Systems Agronomist Steve Attard reports that access to the patched point data has significantly improved his ability to  represent local weather. Consequently, his clients have increased confidence  that the information is relevant to their location and will result in improved  decision-making on their part.</p>
	<p>Steve feels the demand for weather-related  information will increase in the future.</p>
	<p>The use of patched point data increases the reliability of forecasting due to  the large number of data collection points available. Prior to the use of  patched point data, Steve’s firm relied on data collected from a very small  number of weather stations, a factor which made predictions less reliable at  locations where there were no nearby recording stations.</p>
